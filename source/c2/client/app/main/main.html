      <p class='text-justify'>Over the past few years most government entities (state, local, federal, foreign) have begun embracing open data and are increasingly releasing datasets publicly. This movement has vastly increased the amount of data available, but existing applications seem to be designed mainly to view and access individual datasets one at a time. This restriction contradicts the notion that, ultimately, everything is related to everything else. The Corrolator allows a user to make associations between US population, employment, wage, and agriculture data. The user will have the ability to enter a query criteria with results displayed in a geospatial interface.</p>
